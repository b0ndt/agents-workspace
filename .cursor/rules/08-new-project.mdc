# New Project Scaffolding

When starting a new project:

1. Ask for the project name if not provided (kebab-case)
2. The pipeline auto-creates the GitHub repo — just run:
   ```
   npx tsx scripts/pipeline.ts -p <name> -m "<description>" --interactive
   ```
3. Suggest starting with the Requirements Engineer phase

Do NOT create code files — that's the Engineer's job.
Do NOT make up requirements — that's the Requirements Engineer's job.
