# Git Worktree Strategy

Use worktrees to work on multiple projects simultaneously in isolated directories.

## Commands

```bash
bash scripts/worktree.sh create <project>    # New worktree
bash scripts/worktree.sh list                # List active
bash scripts/worktree.sh remove <project>    # Clean up
bash scripts/worktree.sh prune               # Remove stale
```

Worktrees are created at `../AGENTS-wt-<project>/` on branch `feat/<project>`.

## Rules

- Never check out the same branch in two worktrees
- Use the helper script to maintain naming conventions
- Merge back to `main` when complete, then remove the worktree
