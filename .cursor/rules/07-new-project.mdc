# New Project Scaffolding

When the user wants to start a new project, create the following directory structure:

```
<project-name>/
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements/
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── adr/
│   ├── design/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   └── components/
│   └── reviews/
├── src/
├── tests/
└── README.md
```

## Steps

1. Ask for the project name if not provided
2. Create all directories
3. Copy relevant templates from `docs/templates/` into the project's docs folders
4. Create a minimal `README.md` in the project root with the project name and a brief description
5. Announce readiness and suggest starting with `@req-engineer` to define requirements

## Important

- Use kebab-case for the project directory name
- Do NOT create any code files yet — that's the Engineer's job
- Do NOT make up requirements — that's the Requirements Engineer's job
